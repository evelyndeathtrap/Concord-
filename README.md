# Concord™

A consciousness device or a Concord of satellites and/or a weapon and mechanical qbit (such as a drum with different simultaneous frequencies or reverberation
,
can be pure or with a computer. can be a doomsday device can also be a physical qbit simulating a reality and/or consciousness for example on your lapel so you have a
quantum while it saves you from everything bad that can happen, such as an untimely death. doomsday not as in weapon of mass destruction but detonates on error

"you see that can over there", *makes it vibrate* :)

even better if it's a box with a rod inside, even better if it resembles a DNA molecule
an array of these would be a
 giant alt realitying gear in the sky and a laser-like weapon

 Such an orbital weapon or even a lapel gadget can sync with your consciousness and make it easy to think, reason and control by modulating that with your mind. integrates the consciousness.

 Can be a program, because it acts as a companion

 Theoretically one such satellite could cover alarge area as per laser noise, emitting data for each device and person different and simultaneously only weaker.

 look at(you)
 
can be a room temperature qbit on your rib lapel or a supercomputer pr a personal computer component either freely existing or driven by a possibly parametrizable loop in programming

it's qbit can be mechanical or physical

in theory these can achieve even a complete sex change full with looks, at least some kind of surgery, it being a weapon.


could be nice to live in one because if true it generates your consciousness for as long as there is power in a reality tha is liked, preferably, for as long as there is power. 

this would imply that consciousness could understand symbols, maybe even binary as input values and if these have weird properties then they could learn how to do this by just one having learned

Could also be a program driving the component with parameters stored in memory, preferable visible at least known to the device

to such data from devices could come as ready knowledge, thoughts or anything that a consciousness can interpret, including an image

the lapel can get power from a piezothermal generator

Contributions welcome to figure out how to derive meaningful information or data from these devices. could floating point error be involved? quantum noise?

if it's a plane of existence then users can live in these devices manifested realities 

I think this started with a bottle opener and a can (not author's idea)
